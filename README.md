# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
## BIG 0
O(n)
O = function
n - represents number of elements 

- O(1) = static amount of time 
- O(log n) - divide and conquer or binary search
- O(n) directly and linearly with N
- O(NlogN) = merge search
- O(n2) = checking two lists
- O(infinity) - flipping a coin 

Big O is the way we analyze how efficient algorithms (or code in this case) without getting too mired in the details.


## Stacks 
(last in, first out)
two principal operations:
- push, which adds an element to the collection, and
- pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
